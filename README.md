# Microphone-Boombox-App
This app is here to help my mum when she is teaching.

Curently it can get an input then play it back once you click the 'play back' button.

What I am working on is trying to get it so that it plays the input from the mic virtually instantaneously.
I am also having troubles with constraints not doing what I want. Although that is a very beginner type of mistake it still is very annoying and time wasting.
